- Julia Jung


## Agenda
1) Additional alpha diversity analysis
   - Cannot generate p values across all 4 groups
   - Generated a graph with all 4 groups
   - Generated just between no asthma high/low upf --> Significance in Observed and Faith's PD
2) Additional core microbiome analysis
- Would it help to add this into the figure?
3) Clarify the narrative that we can say 
   
## Minutes
#### Additional Analysis
asthma drives a distinct profile in low upf countries but not in high upf countries
-> Saying that they are different is okay as a final conclusion 

microbiome -> alpha diversity & core microbiome (low/high upf)?
further supports alpha diversity 

- alpha diversity: a bigger difference (yes/no asthma) in low upf group
     - they also share less common ASVs having asthma in low upf countries, giving you a more distinct microdiversity profile

- core microbiome: showed more unique taxa (less common taxa between the two)and fewer differences between the two (high upf group)

- hypothesis suggestion:
     - if the initial hypothesis doesn't match the result, don't mention it (not necessary)
     - focus on the intro
       - we don't know what the gut microbiome is doing
       - just end with our result (remove hypothesis)
       - address the knowledge gap
       - broad statement: we are gonna look into the diversity of these groups ~~ or mention it
       - last paragraph of intro: should be in past tense
       - to address this gap, we performed ~~~ diversity of these differences, assessed richness and evenness
       - one sentence of every single analysis
       - what are the main conclusions of the paper
      
- PCoA plot / PERMANOVA
     - permanova table in the supplemental (we can refer to it)
     - most important is showing the asthma coming up  (for the flow)
     - weighted unifrac in the supplemental figure
     - allergies --> no significance in terms of interaction
     - too redundant to put both -> choose just one (between jaccard/bray) -> the other one in the supplemental
     - mention that these two (for allergies/asthma) came up as significant

- ANCOM
     - high upf figures as supplemental figures
     - families that come up in both low and high upf
          - opposite trend in high/low upf
          - decreased abundant in asthmatic patients in low upf
          - vice versa for high upf
          - this needs to be in supp? or not?
      
      - A more concise narrative would be more favourable
        - abundance percentage is too low here, hard to change the conclusion based on this
  
  - go with stronger p-value and evidence
       - include all significant data 
       - high upf goes to supplemental data
       - emphasis on how rigorous the analysis was done
       - shouldn't be over-interpreted

- Comments on our presentation
     - nothing really to add
     - the team that we coached only went over time
     - we had a strong narrative

#### Narrative
broadly how upf consumption differs in 
upf significantly influences diversity
significance relation in asthma not allergies

alpha diversity --> low upf diet was more sensitive
difference between the four groups (alpha)

more homogenized yes/no asthma in low upf
vs no asthma

significant taxa are driving (ancom)

sample size
no asthma is way bigger than yes asthma 
--> Discuss in your limitation
the sample size is not equal 
moving forward we should collect more samples

is it okay to write that in result? or discussion?
-> briefly mention that disparity in the samples can bring the difference in our result (just briefly in the result just one sentence)
-> concluding sentence in my result -> this analysis suggests ~~~ 
sentence of limitation (at the end of each section) 

## Other notes
- Title
     - focus on low upf is more distinct in asthmatic and non-asthmatic
          - how upf was significant was shown in low upf diet
     - focus on the difference in upf consumption
     - Sam suggested: that a low upf diet "may" result in a more distinct microbial profile in consuming high upf diet
          - p-value was lower for the alpha diversity in low upf
          - core microbiome more shared taxa in high upf
