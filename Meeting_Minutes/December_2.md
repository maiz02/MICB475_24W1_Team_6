# December 2 - 11th meeting

## Attendees
- Julia Jung
- Chaeyoon Chang
- Vivian Tan
- Andrea Garcia
- Yna Ortiz

## Agenda
1) Formatting of results
   - What does best practice mean?
   - Is it better to have the panels on different slides?
2) Citations on presentation --> Should we just have a reference slide at the end and in text citations throughout the slides? 
3) Different jaccard axes 
4) Alpha diversity:
   - p-value for Faith's PD
   - Double check understanding for alpha diversity
5) ANCOM
6) PCoA plots
   - Is the new formatting okay?
   - Is it okay to present the supplemental figures at that point? (Hard to explain the direction we go in after without the Bray Curtis and Jaccard results)
   - Weighted Unifrac is the only one where interaction between UPF and asthma is not significant.
   - Should we add Bray Curtis and Jaccard into the final figure 1 for manuscript or not necessary?
   - How can we discuss the clustering (not significant) in relation to the PERMANOVA results? 
8) Why did we choose weighted unifrac for our figure --> distinct clustering?
9) All point form text is in full statements and the order of information is logical
   - Does this mean each point form needs to be a full sentence?
   - Double check logical flow
10) Should we be connecting our findings to previous literature as we discuss them or just make general statements in our conclusions?
11) Future directions

## Minutes
From the slides:
- make titles conclusive
- keep the info about upf but the enterotype stuff might be unnecessary
- a little much background and info currently...
- research question big, and keep the categories, remove experimental aims
- Data...
-    w uni pcoa: remove
- titles shouldnt be figures, it should be the takeaways
- manuscript figure 1: bray curtis and jaccard , write p values, weighthed unifrac as supplemental.
- --> just abundance? is significant but when we used weighted unifrac (including the phylogenetic distance) it wasnt significant
- make a new table of p values (of everything). highlight the significant p values. the table is just for the presentation!!
- no pcoa plots at all for presentation??
- if you want to summarize the plots, do it at the top and make the title of the plot
- alpha diversity metrics (fig2):  3 decimal places for p values, remove the words (trust the other team)
- takeawy: asthma drives diversity in both upf groups
- alpha diversity faiths pd: need to figure out the p values for manuscript, for prsentation pick one alpha diversity metrics (shannon shows more)
- ANCOM: need to redo some stuff, we still have significance but just different species. need to talk about relevance of having ancom data, literature search info
- --> asthma making their lives ...  worse..
- high upf ancom: if stat says significance, theyre significnat
- venn diagrams after alpha diversity metrics
- future direction: ways to improve by reudcing limitations (limitations: only 4 countreis, small cohorts), short-term (something students could do immediately) vs long-term (maybe we wnat to be more specific about what type of diet), want to be relevant, doing downstream analysis with high and low upf together.
- title/conclusion: talk about low upf instead of high: "indiviudals with low upf diet are more susceptible to changes in microbiome due to asthma"
- not much room for discussion
- submit as powerpoint (especiallly if we have animation)
- pcoa plots, put p values but formatting looks good (Eveylnn liked them last time)
- ancom: we had 3-4 significnat families... some have not much info (not studied upon a lot) discuss more about low upf, what was expected, etc
- lit review of ancom results would be what we could talk about in discussion
- no high upf ancom data for presentation
- data for presentation: permanova table (beta diversity) (2 tables, 1 with the separate (upf, asthma, allegies) 1 with the combined) and the takeaways as titles, 1 alpha diversity metric (shannon), venn diagrams, low upf ancom plots
  
## Action Items
- lots of formatting and trimming to do
