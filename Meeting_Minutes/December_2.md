## Attendees
- Julia Jung
- Chaeyoon Chang
- Vivian Tan
- Andrea Garcia
- Yna Ortiz

## Agenda
1) Formatting of results
   - What does best practice mean?
   - Is it better to have the panels on different slides?
2) Citations on presentation --> Should we just have a reference slide at the end and in text citations throughout the slides? 
3) Different jaccard axes 
4) Alpha diversity:
   - p-value for Faith's PD
   - Double check understanding for alpha diversity
5) ANCOM
6) PCoA plots
   - Is the new formatting okay?
   - Is it okay to present the supplemental figures at that point? (Hard to explain the direction we go in after without the Bray Curtis and Jaccard results)
   - Weighted Unifrac is the only one where interaction between UPF and asthma is not significant.
   - Should we add Bray Curtis and Jaccard into the final figure 1 for manuscript or not necessary?
   - How can we discuss the clustering (not significant) in relation to the PERMANOVA results? 
8) Why did we choose weighted unifrac for our figure --> distinct clustering?
9) All point form text is in full statements and the order of information is logical
   - Does this mean each point form needs to be a full sentence?
   - Double check logical flow
10) Should we be connecting our findings to previous literature as we discuss them or just make general statements in our conclusions?
11) Future directions
