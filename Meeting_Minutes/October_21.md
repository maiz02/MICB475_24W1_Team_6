## Agenda
1) Double check chosen sampling depth --> sample-id category was not visible when rarefaction plot was generated
2) Confirm if response variables are good
3) Confirm if we can do both Bray-Curtis and Weighted Unifrac --> we noticed in the paper we got the dataset from that they used both
4) Confirm if the PCoA plot is the best option
5) Double check that the biological relevance is enough --> we brought up the difference in diet between the regions
6) Double check that difference in sample size is okay --> 4 and 5 for Spain, 1 in both country and allergies/asthma
