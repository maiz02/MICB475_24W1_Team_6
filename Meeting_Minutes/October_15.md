# October 7 - 3rd meeting

## Attendees

## Agenda
1) Update on our data wrangling so far
2) Assign parts for team proposal
   
## Minutes
# Update on data wrangling
- Was able to subset the manifest file based on filtered metadata file
- Combined columns to be used --> combined into final metadata file
  - Includes combined columns and all other columns from original metadata

# Assigning parts for team proposal 
1) Introduction and Background - Julia
   - Why question is important
   - How does it fit into current literature --> Builds up into primary research question
   - Build up knowledge gap and motivation
   - Start discussing relationship between asthma and allergies
   - We are looking at lots of variables so be clear about it from the start
2) Research objectives - Vivian
   - Primary research question and hypothesis
   - Aims should answer this primary question
   - Overarching theme of project
   - Research: Whether allergies or asthma changes the diversity of the microbiome across different countries
   - Hypothesis: A difference exists between the regions in terms of the diversity of the microbiome (in relation to disease states)
   - Look at literature on whether the richness of the microbiome affects the disease state of people 
3) Experimental aims and rationale - Vivian
   - Length: Should there be a paragraph of rationale per aim? --> From 2 to 5 paragraphs per aim, talk about previous existing literature
4) Proposed approach - Chaeyoon
   - Aim 1: Characterize the diversity of microbiomes for patients with and without allergies in each country and compare across countries
   - Aim 2: Characterize the diversity of microbiomes for patients with and without asthma in each country and compare across countries 
   - Aim 3: Identify biomarkers/species in the microbiome between patients with and without asthma and/or allergies in each country, and compare across countries
   - Can use different analysis for each aim
   - Is the main comparison country or disease state?
   - Simplest would probably be indicator species as additional step --> Aim 3 (What sort of species do you want in order to not have asthma or allergies? Could be different between different regions)
   - Initial analysis would be calculating diversity then using statistics to compare between groups (Aims 1 and 2)
     - Possibly use PERMANOVA
     - Generate PCA plot and see distance between the groups --> compare samples based on a lot of parameters (for this, not a very statisical approach to comparing distances, usually more visual interpretation) 
6) Overview flowchart - Yna
7) Weekly timeframe - Yna
8) Dataset overview - Andrea
9) Participation report - Everyone/Julia

# Other notes
- Another group is also working on asthma/allergies --> just comparing age groups instead of countries or region
  - Try not to touch on age in our research
- Evelyn is really looking for biological aim to objective --> ex. We expect that the effects on asthma and allergies will be different due to diet
  - Need literature and data to back up this biological aspect
  - Touches on rationale
- Make sure that logic connects the sections
- Title should have "-ing" --> for us, "Comparing Microbiome between Regions"
- Approach from a more biological standpoint
 
 ## Action Items
- Start working on our individual parts for the proposal
- Look at literature and meet again later this week to definitively decide on approaches for the aims
