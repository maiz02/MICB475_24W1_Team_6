## Agenda
1) - Github organizing 
    - Figures and analysis that were not used?
2) Fixed title 
- Low ultra processed food (UPF) diets may be associated with greater gut microbiome differences between asthmatic and non-asthmatic individuals than high-UPF diets
- Low-UPF diets may amplify greater gut microbiome differences between asthmatic and non-asthmatic individuals than high-UPF diets
3) Introduction
    - Less homogenized microbiome meaning —> How can we clarify this?
4) Results
    - Making the headers more biological?
5) Discussion 
    - What does this mean? How would “masking” look like? the no asthma groups across all UPF levels are somewhat similar
    - Why is this relevant and why are you using 1% here? Many if not most microbes in the gut will be below 1% relative abundance —> comment on presentation that the relative abundances are low?
6) Figures
    - What does this mean: Explained variance, also in S1A & S1B is very low, i’m not expecting visual difference to be relevant
    - Put all figures before tables for supplemental
    - permanova —> was told to put p values on the graph?
    - Was told to use distinct colors per group for boxplots 
7) Overall
    - hedging —> using may?
    - talking about sample size in each results section
