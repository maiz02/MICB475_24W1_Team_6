# December 16 

## Attendees
- Andrea Garcia
- Yna Ortiz
- Julia Jung
- Chaeyoon Chang
- Vivian Tan 

## Agenda
1) - Github organizing 
    - Figures and analysis that were not used?
2) Fixed title 
- Low ultra processed food (UPF) diets may be associated with greater gut microbiome differences between asthmatic and non-asthmatic individuals than high-UPF diets
- Low-UPF diets may amplify greater gut microbiome differences between asthmatic and non-asthmatic individuals than high-UPF diets
3) Introduction
    - Less homogenized microbiome meaning —> How can we clarify this?
4) Results
    - Making the headers more biological?
5) Discussion 
    - What does this mean? How would “masking” look like? the no asthma groups across all UPF levels are somewhat similar
    - Why is this relevant and why are you using 1% here? Many if not most microbes in the gut will be below 1% relative abundance —> comment on presentation that the relative abundances are low?
6) Figures
    - What does this mean: Explained variance, also in S1A & S1B is very low, i’m not expecting visual difference to be relevant
    - Put all figures before tables for supplemental
    - permanova —> was told to put p values on the graph?
    - Was told to use distinct colors per group for boxplots 
7) Overall
    - hedging —> using may?
    - talking about sample size in each results section

## Minutes
#### Github Organizing
- Leave analyses in Github that were not used

#### Title
- Title is okay! --> Just leave it as vague since we did not have clear trends
- Other titles are also okay 

#### Introduction
- Just be more specific in saying that the groups had less shared ASVs --> say they don't have a shared standard profile

#### Results
- Level of UPF consumption appears to influence gut microbiome structure and has a significant interaction with asthma --> change to Levels of UPF consumption may influence changes/composition in gut microbial community, which may also be influenced by complications with asthma (and not allergies)
- More wordy for figure caption and more concise for results title
- For alpha diversity, can make more conclusions --> asthma seems to significantly reduce diversity of community, further compounded by low UPF diet
- Hedge statements more in terms of high vs low UPF --> say this MAY be further compounded but we do see trend in high UPF
- ANCOM: Header should be more direct that the families show a greater susceptibility to changes when it comes to asthma --> still significant 

#### Discussion
- Don't address percentages
- Masking is not ideal wording --> High UPF diets has some effects on its own that could be lessening/reducing effect of asthma we typically see on microbiome, but mention that high vs low UPF has not been compared and decrease is still seen (hedge)

#### Figures
- Should be more biological captions --> it is okay to be a bit more observational here! (compared to results)
- PCoA plots: Low variance on axes on PCoA --> major limitation of PCoA plot (address in limitations section: with the dataset that we have, explained variance is only 16% on axes, doesn't actually explain relationship between points very well, to improve we should correct for confounding variables)
- Keep with tables then figures
- Keep p values in plot, MENTION IN CAPTION --> keep figures as they are, but redraw ellipses with the asthma/allergies (to differentiate panels more!) and in caption just say p values less than 0.05 (don't list everything out) 
- Colors are okay!
- Fix size of panels for Figure 1, fix align for Figure 2, Figure 3 and 4 look good
- Core microbiome: Include ??? (sorry I did not hear)
- Body of figure legend is more technical

#### Overall
- Hedge! Best practice
- Not everything they say is something we need to comply it --> just address in response to reviewer (key limitations)
- Sample size limitation: Don't mention in each results section, mention in methods --> clearly talk about groupings and sizings
