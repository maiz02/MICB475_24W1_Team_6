# November 18 - 9th meeting

## Attendees
- Yna Ortiz
- Julia Jung
- Chaeyoon Chang
- Vivian Tan
- Andrea Garcia

## Agenda
1) Determine key figures for manuscript
2) Discuss findings from new figures
   - Core Microbiome
   - ISA
   - ANCOM
   - Alpha diversity plots
3) Adjusted weighted UniFrac PCoA plot
  - Unique color combination --> is there a way to change the colors?
4) Results for Aim 3
  - Check if ISA is commensal bacteria
5) Presentation due date

## Minutes
#### Alpha Diversity
- High UPF: no significance
- Low UPF: significance is present
- Need to check with statistics
- Consistent results which are good
- Good to have Observed, Shannon's, Faith's PD --> Try and put Faith's PD on the same panel 
- Low UPF seems to have more sensitive microbiomes --> maybe because high UPF affects microbiome significantly such that it masks effects of asthma

#### Updated PCoA plot
- Preferred the old plot because the different colors are difficult to understand
- Do it again the old way with the ellipses around presence of allergier/asthma
- Split up asthma and allergies for Weighted Unifrac, Bray Curtis, and Jaccard with ellipses
- Probably will go with weighted because the clustering is better
- Maybe Bray Curtis and Jaccard in supplemental

#### ANCOM
- Low UPF --> Asthma reduces relative abundance majority of the time (check if bacteria is associated with commensal or pathogenic bacteria) = Mostly decrease (omit the not well annotated family UCG010 --> mention 6 significant families but only show 5 because it was not annotated well)
- Blast the unannotated group
- Don't omit UCG010
- Fix the axes for ANCOM

#### Core Microbiome
- Low is more unique
- Asthma seems to be depleting unique species --> driving decrease in diversity

#### ISA
- No need!
- No stat value above 0.8 --> not very indicative 

#### Figures
1) Figure 1: Weighted unifrac --> do ellipses for presence of asthma/allergies only
- Panel A: Allergies
- Panel B: Asthma
- Put stats in figure legend
- Story: started broadly
2) Figure 2: Alpha Diversity, 6 panels 
- Observed, Shannon's, Faith
- Top: High
- Bottom: Low
- Relabel bottom axes --> Yes or no (No need for UPF High)
- Low UPF is more susceptible to change in asthma
3) Figure 3: ANCOM, 6 panels
- Low UPF only (6 panels)
- Keep the unannotated group!
4) Figure 4: Core Microbiome
- 2 panels
- Top: Low
- Bottom: High
- Less shared with low UPF --> drive 
5) S1: Bray Curtis, Jaccard PCoA plots
- Same format as Figure 1
6) S2: ANCOM High UPF

#### Presentation
- Simplify figures for presentation (Different from manuscript)
- Don't show all for beta diversity
- Pick what is more interesting based on previous published data
- Can choose to show supplemental

#### Manuscript
- Don't need to mention ISA (original aim 3)
- Main conclusion: High UPF diet seems to mask changes in microbiome driven by asthma

## Action Items
- Make presentation slides
- Fix PCoA and ANCOM figures
- Meeting next Monday!
