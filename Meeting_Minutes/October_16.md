# October 16 - 5th meeting

## Attendees
- Andrea Garcia
- Yna Ortiz
- Julia Jung
- Chaeyoon Chang
- Vivian Tan 

## Agenda
1) Finalize foundation of project proposal
   
## Minutes
- Asthma and allergy --> lots of literature in terms of the relationship
- Epidemiology of allergies in a global context --> more people are becoming allergic to food
  - Idea for introduction, background, and rationale
- Check if other studies that focus on indicator species or microbiome composition for people with allergies
#### Title
- Exploring the relationship of allergies and asthma on the diversity of gut microbiomes across different countries
#### Introduction
- Connect to different countries and their different microbiomes
- Link between allergies and asthma
- General literature on microbiomes affecting health conditions --> focus on immunology aspect because it is directly tied with allergies and other health conditions
- Biological relevance of this --> Why do we care about what affects the incidence of allergies and asthma?
- Start building up to what knowledge gap exists
- Focus on how we are studying adults
- Yna sent a link to an article about how allergies, asthma, and microbiomes are related
#### Research Objectives
- Primary research question: How do allergies and asthma change the diversity of the gut microbiome across different countries?
- Hypothesis
  - We do think there will be a difference in the effect of asthma and allergies on the diversity of the gut microbiome across different countries
  - Biological aspect --> talk about why we think countries will have an effect on this (diet of different countries and how it affects the microbiome)
  - Higher saturated fats and more processed foods could lead to decrease in microbiome --> could affect risk of allergies
  - Make a point that increase/decrease in diversity of microbiome (if there is a difference between the groups) can be targeted by diets or therapeutics in early life to prevent development of asthma/allergies
#### Experimental Aims
- Make them more clear
- Aim 1: Characterizing the beta diversity of gut microbiomes for individuals with and without allergies across different countries
#### Proposed Approach 
- Aim 1: Characterize the diversity of microbiomes for patients with and without allergies in each country and compare across countries
- Aim 2: Characterize the diversity of microbiomes for patients with and without asthma in each country and compare across countries
  - For the first 2:
    - Calculate beta diversity (between groups) then use PERMANOVA to see how it affects allergies/asthma and country 
    - Weighted UniFrac or Bray-Curtis --> depends on what we think will be affected more (phylogenetic distance, richness, abundance)
    - Also depends on how well resolved our phylogenetic trees are
    - Will have to see based literature what aspects of diversity we should focus on --> What is established?
    - Possible to not do statistical tests --> Just describe changes between the countries
- Aim 3: Identify biomarkers/species in the microbiome between patients with and without asthma and/or allergies in each country, and compare across countries
  - Indicator species analysis, compare between countries
  - Biological significance: which species do we want/not want to prevent health conditions? --> Therapeutic?
  
 ## Action Items
1) Work on individual parts of group proposal
2) Next meeting: 10pm Saturday (October 16th) on Zoom
   - Message in the group chat if any urgent issues come up before Saturday so we just finalize on Saturday
