# October 28 - 7th meeting

## Attendees
- Andrea Garcia
- Yna Ortiz
- Julia Jung
- Chaeyoon Chang
- Vivian Tan 

## Agenda
1) Project proposal comments from Sam
   - If there are any gaps in the introduction and rationale
   - Double check steps in proposed approach
   - Explanations in data set overview --> double check justification for truncation length and sampling depth
   - Citation of Deblur 
3) Timeline of when we get comments back, when we will be expected to resubmit the project proposal
4) Ask what we can start on in terms of actual analysis for the project
5) Finalize rewording of the aims and research question based on UPF
6) Finalize the metrics we are doing --> based on her email, doing Core Microbiome and DeSeq
   - For core microbiome, is this for 4 groups (healthy and allergies/asthma) within each UPF group or 2 groups?
8) Double check for introduction --> Sam mentioned not using the healthy population 
   
## Minutes

- Timeline: will be released tmr
  - What should be revised for the second submission
   - The intro and background can be revised - why asthma and allergies? -> mention it in the intro
   - the project has been changed -> but the revision grading will be based on the feedback 
   - Figure title should be re-positioned
   - research question should be more in detail
   - The proposal won't be held accountable for the later steps
   - countries -> reword them to low/high UPF groups (research question and intro) - don't touch the wording of the rest of the proposal
   - in the revised proposal, just pretend we don't do the new proposal -> re-grading will be done on whether the feedbacks are revised or not
   - New research question
      - should we add this to a new research question/proposal?
         - If that makes more clearer
         - Change the research objective not similar to the title

- Rarefaction
   - will try duplicating the samples (not a requirement for the presentation - no need to work on it if it is not working)
   - We don't have to mention it in the methods section

- Oral presentation will be on Dec 3rd & 5th
  - Analysis should be done 2 weeks before the oral presentation so that we have time to work on troubleshooting if needed

- Aim 1 & 2 -> deadline (Nov 18th)
   - Half of the team will work on asthma, and the other half on allergies (Aim 1 & 2)
   - since we are doing multivariable -> steps should be changed
     - Now we are looking at the UPF groups
     - instead of doing it within the countries, each country will be analyzed unbiasedly
         - Start with the unbiased analysis country-wise, then pull up the PCoA plot to group the high/low UPF countries
         - ex) label countries with the colours of the dots, yes/no allergies with the size of the dots etc..
         - If the similarity within the high UPF / low UPF group is dictated, -> UPF consumption is changing the diversity of the gut microbiome
         - Variable would be each country, and then with/without allergies/asthma
         - Condition of allergies/asthma and UPF consumption group should be in one plot for each aim (Aim 1&2)
   - beta diversity metrics -> Do all of the metrics -> and then do the Permanova
        - If the results show differences between the metrics, then we can assume that that's because of the difference in the aspects of each metric (highlight the differences in the aspects each metric emphasizes)

- Aim 3: Analyzing the differential abundance
   - DESeq / Core microbiome / Indicator species in all aspects

- In general, for the final manuscript:
  - How do allergies and asthma relate to the change of diversity within the gut microbiome between countries with high and low ultra-processed food intake? -> can be the new proposal question
  - introducing more variables like UPF other than countries -> keep the countries for the titles, add the UPF more into the intro

 
 ## Action Items
 
- Start working on the analysis of aims 1 & 2 (deadline: Nov 18th)
- We will keep our meeting on Mondays, in person as usual
