# October 28 - 7th meeting

## Attendees
- Andrea Garcia
- Yna Ortiz
- Julia Jung
- Chaeyoon Chang
- Vivian Tan 

## Agenda
1) Project proposal comments from Sam
   - If there are any gaps in the introduction and rationale
   - Double check steps in proposed approach
   - Explanations in data set overview --> double check justification for truncation length and sampling depth
   - Citation of Deblur 
3) Timeline of when we get comments back, when we will be expected to resubmit the project proposal
4) Ask what we can start on in terms of actual analysis for the project
5) Finalize rewording of the aims and research question based on UPF
6) Finalize the metrics we are doing --> based on her email, doing Core Microbiome and DeSeq
   - For core microbiome, is this for 4 groups (healthy and allergies/asthma) within each UPF group or 2 groups?
8) Double check for introduction --> Sam mentioned not using the healthy population 
   
## Minutes

- Timeline: will be released tmr
The intro and background can be revised - why asthma and allergies? mention it in the intro
project has been changed - but the revision grading will be based on the feedback 
Figure title should be re-positioned
research question should be more in detail
The proposal won't be held accountable for the later steps
countries -> reword them to low/high UPF groups (research question and intro) - don't touch the rest of the proposal

Rarefaction - will try duplicating the samples (not a requirement for the presentation - no need to do so if it is not working)
don't have to mention it in the methods section

- New research question
  Adding these to the revised proposal - should we add a new research question/proposal?
  -> If that makes more clearer
  -> Change the research objective not similar to the title
  
- Oral presentation will be on Dec 3rd / 5th
  - Analysis should be done 2 weeks before the oral presentation

- Splitting aims
   - Half of the team work on asthma, and the other half on allergies (on Aim 1 & 2)
   - Aim 3: looking at the asthma and allergies altogether
 
- Aim 1 & 2: since we are doing multivariable -> steps should be changed
     - Now we are looking at the UPF groups
     - instead of doing it within the countries, just look at the whole thing
     - in the proposal just pretend we don't do the new proposal (UPF)

- beta diversity metrics -> Do all of the metrics
- if there are differences between the results of the metrics, then we can say that that's because of the phylogenetic distance (what weighted unifrac does)

- Sample groups - are we doing healthy vs patients (allergies, asthma) and also account for the High & low UPF groups
  - beta diversity -> then Permanova
  - put the countries first, and then similarity was dictated because the country is high/low UPf -> UPF is changing the diversity
  - use PCoA plot
  - variable is country, with/without allergies
  - group the high UPF and low UPF with the oval
  - No allergies  / Yes allergies / High UPF / Low UPF in one plot for each aim
 
- For the first two aims -> do the countries first
     - start with unbiasedly analysis country-wise -> then the PCoA plot shows low UPF countries are grouped / high UPF countries grouped
     - country -> label with colour, yes/no allergies -> label with the size, group the high/low UPF countries
 
- Differential abundance -> for Aim 3
  - DESeq and core microbiome and indicator species

- In general, for the final manuscript:
  -How do allergies and asthma relate to the change of diversity within the gut microbiome between countries with high and low ultra-processed food intake? -> can be the new proposal question
  - introducing more variables like UPF other than countries -> keep the countries for the titles, add the UPF more into the intro

- Setting the deadline for aims 1 & 2
  - until Nov 18th
 
- We will keep our meeting on Mondays, in person as usual
 
 ## Action Items
- Start working on the analysis of aims 1 & 2 (deadline: Nov 18th)
